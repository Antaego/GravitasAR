# GravitasAR
A small proof of concept AR Game built in unity;



In the near future, an asteroid mining complex in orbit around Ceres suffers a critical systems faliure. Meanwhile, you and your voyager ship are on a return trip from Jupiter. You have only enough fuel to get you directly to jupiter, unless you use gravitation to your advantage...

Thousands of lives hang on backup systems that recycle the air, filter the water, and keep the background microwave radiation from being your only source of heat. Only you can save them from starvation and hypothermia by picking them up on your way back to the mother station in orbit around earth.

Use the left and right arrows to rotate your ship, and the thrust button to boost.
The top right has a restart button to set your ship back at the starting point.
