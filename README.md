# GravitasAR
A small proof of concept AR Game built in unity.

You must save the Asteroid mining station from starvation and hypothermia by picking them up on your way back to the mother station in

Use the left and right arrows to rotate your ship, and the thrust button to boost.
The top right has a restart button to set your ship back at the starting point.
